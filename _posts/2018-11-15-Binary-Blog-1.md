    <td>Today's lesson was mainly a discussion lesson, as we discussed what our next topic was and we went through some things like binary and all of the other ones. We then talked about the website ascii and how it had all of the numbers in binary, hexadecimal and more. We then went through some binary numbers and then we talked about solutions on google spreadsheets that would help us with our binary work. After some more discussion, we then got set off to do some work. The first stage of the work was to write in hello world and then separate the letters separately but as it was almost the end of the lesson, we had to quickly copy and paste the table of printable only binary codes, on the ascii website.
