    <td>First we spent around 20 minutes talking about how to deconcatenate and we reviewed and recapped it due to the fact that we had already covered it briefly in a previous cover lesson.
I had the alphabet table, I had the section with all of my data, and I also had the pastable work, the decoded work and the encrypted work. I then added more code, trying to use the deconcatenate. I understood it, but i did struggle a bit with typing down the code, which I had to ask help for.

    <td>I need to work more faster and more efficiently, in this case to manage to finish all of the work on using deconcatenate, which I almost completed.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will work more quickly, so I can get on and do the work more efficiently, instead of not managing to complete all of the lessons work.
I will also try to persevere through hard times, and will ask help if I need to do so next time.</td>
