    <td>We started off by logging onto Replit and then we talked about the code we used last lesson which was on "for". It was about it calculating the amount of money the paperboy and papergirl earned for each paper they sold. I had already completed that so I moved onto today's code where we had to calculate how many matches were played and then how many goals were scored. We then talked about the code where we had to do a quiz and it asked a question and if you got it wrong it would say so and if you got it right then it would say so. I started that and we got that to finish off afterwards. I managed to complete it with some help from a friend but apart from that I didn't need any other help. </td>

    <td>When I was doing my blog I did get a few syntax errors as I did forget some of the code, but I did manage to ask a friend who helped me with my code. Otherwise I had no other troubles.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to work out the code first without asking help first and I will carry on working efficiently.</td>
