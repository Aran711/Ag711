    <td>We started off by logging into Replit. We then listened to the teacher walk us through the slideshow about elifs and else. The slideshow showed us some examples of the code we had to write like answering a question. We then had the task to write our own code on python and mine was about a security system and you had to answer the correct name, age, password and secret message. If you got any of them wrong then it would say "intruder". YOu could programme it to say what you like when you got the question wrong or right. I had to use the else to get it to say “intruder” as if it was anything else from the answer, then it would be wrong. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I did struggle a bit with code when it had the exclamation mark as when writing an input you can't put a space in it, which I did so I have to remember to not put a space in it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will remember certain rules that will make the code work when using python and I will carry on working efficiently.</td>
