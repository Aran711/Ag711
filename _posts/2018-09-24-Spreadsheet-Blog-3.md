    <td>In the lesson we went over what we did last lesson, and we continued from there. We went over last weeks work on using concatenate to decode our work. We then looked at new things to do, with other methods of decoding. We also got told that sometimes if there is and error in your code you have to write "if error", and then put a comma after the bracket, and then another bracket. I used that in my code when there was an error, and it worked. We then had to finish our decoding, which I managed to do successfully. Then if we had finished we then had to work out how to decode by only using the shifts, though I din not get onto that part.

  <tr>
    <td>I could have worked more efficiently on the decoding part so I could have finished earlier. Then I could have done the decoding by only using shifts, though by the time I finished my decoding it was the end of the lesson. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will ask for help if I need to so I can then move onto the next task instead of taking a longer time working it out. I will also try to work faster so I can get onto the next part of the work.</td>
