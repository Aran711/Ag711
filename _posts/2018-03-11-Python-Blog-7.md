    <td>As our teacher was absent, we were told to work through Codecademy. I resumed on my topic which was on Pig Latin. I had to make a translator and it would ask me to enter a word, and then it would translate it into Pig Latin. The code had parts where it took away some of the word, and then added "ay" to the end or something similar to that. Here is the code for the Pig Latin translator: pyg = 'ay'

original = raw_input('Enter a word:')

if len(original) > 0 and original.isalpha():
  word = original.lower()
  first = word[0]
  new_word = word + first + pyg
  new_word = new_word[1:len(new_word)]
else:
    print 'empty'

I then went onto the next topic, which was functions. I managed to do the first few exercises of the topic. I then earned my seventh badge from completing the Pig Latin topic.</td>
