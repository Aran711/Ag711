    <td>As our teacher wasn't here, we continued to carry on working on codecademy from last lesson. I was on the function stage where I was on the second exercise which was where I had to code where the vacation was, how much it was and also how much I was going to spend there. I managed to complete that but when I first went onto it, it didn’t load so I had to refresh the code. After that exercise I then moved onto the next topic which was Lists & Dictionaries. It first asked me to add another animal in a list of animals in a zoo. I then had to swap an animal with another animal and I had to use the number [4] in brackets if it was the fourth animal that I was swapping. I then had to list what items I was going to pack into the suitcase, though I got it wrong as I didn’t know that you weren’t allowed to change what you were packing. Here is some of the code that I used:def hotel_cost(nights):
  return 140 * nights

def plane_ride_cost(city):
  if city == "Charlotte":
    return 183
  elif city == "Tampa":
    return 220
  elif city == "Pittsburgh":
    return 222
  elif city == "Los Angeles":
    return 475

def rental_car_cost(days):
  cost = days * 40
  if days >= 7:
    cost -= 50
  elif days >= 3:
    cost -= 20
  return cost

def trip_cost(city, days, spending_money):
  return rental_car_cost(days) + hotel_cost(days) + plane_ride_cost(city) + spending_money
print trip_cost("Los Angeles", 5, 600)

zoo_animals = ["pangolin", "cassowary", "sloth", "Parastratiosphecomyia_stratiosphecomyioides" ];
# One animal is missing!

if len(zoo_animals) > 3:
  print "The first animal at the zoo is the " + zoo_animals[0]
  print "The second animal at the zoo is the " + zoo_animals[1]
  print "The third animal at the zoo is the " + zoo_animals[2]
  print "The fourth animal at the zoo is the " + zoo_animals[3]

    <td>With the second stage, I changed the packing equipment which made it not work. I changed it back and it managed to work fine. I did also find the second stage confusing with all of the numbers in brackets, but afterwards I did manage to find out what it was for, and I was able to complete that exercise.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>I will try to read the instructions and the information that it gives me more clearly so that I know how to complete that exercise. I will carry on trying to work efficiently.</td>
