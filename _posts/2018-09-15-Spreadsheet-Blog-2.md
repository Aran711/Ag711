    <td>We started off by listening to our teacher giving examples of encoding and decoding on google sheets and finding other ways to get the decoded and encoded answer. We used concatenate for the code to put everything back together so if we did something wrong with  the decoding we could concatenate and have it where we started. We then finished listening and went back to our work, where were had to concatenate first and then start decoding. I managed to figure out the decode using concatenate with my partner, and then we had to help others who weren't sure if we had done it ourselves first. I then helped two people who needed help by telling them what to do. Then if we had done we could try and find other ways to decode the code. One example was taking each letter separately and decoding them separately which seemed to work. By then it was the end of the lesson so I’d didn’t get to find many ways of decoding.

    <td>At first I was a bit unsure about how the decoding worked at the beginning when the teacher was explaining it, but then I understood when I tried to get it. I then checked I was right with my friend. I was also stuck on another part, but another person came to help, which I used for my coding.</td>

    <td>I did attempt to understand the decoding first before asking a friend which I did and that was my target from last week and I will try to keep that going and understand first myself and then ask for help from others if I still do not understand.</td>
