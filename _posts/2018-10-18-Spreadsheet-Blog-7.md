    <td>In today's lesson we had to continue our code on Google Spreadsheets. Our teacher gave us the Google Classroom code, in which we had to join the Classroom. By the end of the lesson we had to have handed in our coding work on Google Spreadsheets using the deconcatenate and some other code that we had used last lesson. We had to hand it in honestly, regardless whether we were a few stages behind than other people in the class. I managed to get to the stage where I was happy with my work. I then handed it in.
