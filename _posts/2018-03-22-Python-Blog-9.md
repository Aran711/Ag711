    <td>As our teacher was not here again, we continued with codecademy. I was working on numbers where there was a list of numbers and it had to choose one of the numbers and multiply that by two. I managed to complete that and I asked a friend to help me with that exercise. I then moved onto the next stage where there was a set of numbers and it had to choose one and find the square of it. I managed to complete that task fine. Then the next few tasks were to do with a list of animals and I had to find out the index of one of the animals. I did ask for help from a friend for that one, but apart from that I was fine. Here is some of the code that I used: menu = {} # Empty dictionary
menu['Chicken Alfredo'] = 14.50 # Adding new key-value pair
print menu['Chicken Alfredo']

# Your code here: Add some dish-price pairs to menu!




print "There are " + str(len(menu)) + " items on the menu."
print menu

    <td>I will try to persevere more instead of asking a friend straight away, and that's how I can improve. I will carry on trying to work efficiently.</td>
