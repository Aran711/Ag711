    <td>We started off by logging into Replit. Our teacher was then going through an example of what we were doing. We had to write code for a paperboy or a papergirl asking them how much them how many papers they sold and then finally telling them how much they earned as each paper costed 10p. We had to complete that code which I managed to do which not much struggle. We then had to move onto our next one where we had to make up our own version. Mine was that whenever I fire someone I earn money, so it asked me how many people did you fire 7 times, once every day and then it would tell me the total amount of money I earned. </td>

    <td>There weren't many syntax errors or many exclamation marks but I could work on remembering some of the rules like when doing a variable it all has to be one word.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will remember certain rules like there can be no spaces in a variable and I will carry on trying to work more efficiently.</td>
