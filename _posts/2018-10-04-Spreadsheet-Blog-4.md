    <td>First we had to log onto our account and start up google spreadsheets. We then had to go to the front and then we talked about the decoding and about other methods. The teacher then showed us his spreadsheet and wanted our one to work like it. We then had to go back and complete our own code. Though I was behind because I didn't add the alphabet grid until the lesson, as I didn’t need it last lesson as I used my old code. So I made the alphabet grid and then I copied and pasted my previous code into the new one. I then started to work on my decoding. I already had managed to decode my work, and then I also managed to put my encryption into the normal code, by doing the reverse order. I then had to do another thing that was similar to the previous one, and I started doing that.

  <tr>
    <td>As I didn’t need the grid in the last lesson, I didn’t add it, but in this lesson I needed it so I managed to do it, but is was still behind. I still managed to do the lessons work though.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will add the grid quickly and do it before the lesson, so is can get on and do the work more efficiently, instead of not managing to complete all of the lessons work.</td>
