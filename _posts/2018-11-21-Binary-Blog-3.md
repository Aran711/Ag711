    <td>Last lesson recap: We came to the front and had a discussion about binary and our work, and then we had to go back to our places and use the ascii website for reference and to help our code and complete some of our work. This week I continued to work on the spreadsheet. From last lesson, we had to type in a sentence or phrase that had to include a capital letter and a lowercase letter. My phrase was hello world. I successfully managed to split it up into eleven cells, and then I continued the work. I then started to deconcatenate it, which was the next step in our binary google spreadsheet project. It was then the end of the lesson.

  <tr>
    <td>Nothing much limited my learning, though I did struggle a lot with the splitting of cells, as for some reason it was not working for me. I asked some friends and they helped me, and in the end after a while, it managed to work.</td>

    <td>Next time I will persevere through tough times and then I will work quickly to move onto the next task. I will try more and attempt to work out and find the solution by myself more before I ask my friends.</td>
