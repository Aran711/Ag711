    <td>First our teacher told us about the work that we had to do. We did and overview and briefly talked about what we did last lesson, and then he told us what our task was for the lesson. The task was to complete the code and get as much done by the end of the lesson. We had to continue our code, and this time we had to workout how to hide all of the data inside one of the boxes and then press or change a number to get the data back up again. I managed to do most of it, as I had to finish the work from last week and then I started to code my work so it would hide the data. I managed to write most of the code down, but I didn't manage to complete all of it as it was already the end of the lesson.
