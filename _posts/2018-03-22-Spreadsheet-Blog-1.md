    <td>We started of by deleting our old blogs to make new ones. Once that was done we had to make a spreadsheet on google and the teacher then walked us through what we were supposed to do. I then created the spreadsheet and we had to type in a-z down the spreadsheet, and then c-z next to that list. We then had to make the spreadsheet find the letters by decoding a specific code and putting a word or two back into code. The words that we used were "Hello World", which is something that most computer say. We then typed that in and then we had to highlighted it green to show what we were doing. Then we selected it to copy the list of -z and then later we had the words in code.
