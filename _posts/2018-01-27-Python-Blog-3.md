    <td>I started off by completing the 1st worksheet and I managed to do it without any issues. I found the rest of that fairly easy and then I managed to move onto the 2nd worksheet. I had to complete the table by writing it out onto python. I found that ok and I moved on quickly. I then started the 3rd worksheet, similar to the 1st, and I had to programme it to ask how many hours I sleep per night and then per week, per month and per year. I managed to complete the first stage and will continue the next two stages next lesson. I also didn't have many troubles and managed to work through it quickly.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>On the 1st worksheet there was a slight problem as there was an error mark on one of the lines, and it didn’t say anything about why it was wrong. I asked the people around me and they didn’t know either so I just ignored that part and moved onto the next one, as I could use the part without the error mark.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will try to understand why I have error marks and I will carry on working at my own pace and work through the worksheets efficiently.</td>
