    <td>We were told to spend 10 minutes at home on code academy as we were going to start something new in the lesson. We had to start the actual python and start coding. Our teacher posted a worksheet on google classroom to go through in the lesson. I started to go down and I managed to get to stage 4 out of 7. My computer did go a bit weird as the screen went sideways, but I managed to fix it and go through the worksheet. At home on codecademy, I managed to complete another stage and got my 5th badge. It was for the date and time stage where I had to programme it to tell the date and time. After a bit of confusion I was able to complete the stage.</td>

    <td>The computer screen tilted sideways which limited my time on python but I still managed to go through and complete the questions on the worksheet. At home on codecademy I misread one of the questions and I was stuck on it for a while, but I reread it and managed to figure out where I went wrong and I corrected my mistakes.</td>

    <td>I will read the questions more carefully on python and codecademy and I will work through it efficiently.</td>
